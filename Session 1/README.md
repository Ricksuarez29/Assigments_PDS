## Introduction
This project contains all the exercises for session 1 of PDS.

## Syntax and Variables
This section includes exercises that help understand basic Python syntax and the use of variables. The exercises cover value assignment, printing results, and basic mathematical operations.

## Lists and Dictionaries
Here, youâ€™ll explore handling lists and dictionaries in Python. The exercises include creating, accessing, and manipulating these data types, which are fundamental for storing and organizing information.

## Tuples and Sets
The exercises in this section focus on using tuples and sets. Tuples are useful for storing immutable data, while sets allow working with collections of unique elements.

## Control Flow
This part presents exercises that teach how to manage control flow in Python using conditional structures and loops. This includes making decisions based on conditions and repeating code blocks.

## Functions
The functions section covers defining and using functions in Python. The exercises teach how to encapsulate logic within reusable functions, and how to pass parameters and return values.
