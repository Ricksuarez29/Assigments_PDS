# README - Session 8 Plotting

## Python Version -
- **Python 3.11.9**

## Exercise
In this session, we delve into data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn. Here are the exercises and their objectives:

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: To create and manipulate dataframes for analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For creating plots and visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For creating enhanced visualizations.

## Brief Explanation

### Visualization Exercises:

1. **Line Plot: Study Time by Student Name**
    - Objective: Create a line plot showing how study time varies by student name and identify the student with the highest study time.

2. **Histogram: Distribution of Grades**
    - Objective: Plot a histogram of grades and determine the grade range with the highest frequency of students.

3. **ECDF Plot: Grades**
    - Objective: Create an ECDF plot for grades and determine the percentage of students scoring less than 85.

4. **Strip Plot: Grade Distribution by Course**
    - Objective: Create a strip plot showing grade distribution for each course and identify the course with the most spread in grades.

5. **Swarm Plot: Study Time by Gender**
    - Objective: Create a swarm plot to show the relationship between gender and study time, and determine which gender has a higher average study time.


6. **Point Plot: Average Grade by Course**
    - Objective: Create a point plot to show the average grade for each course and identify the course with the highest average grade.
