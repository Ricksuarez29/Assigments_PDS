## Brief Explanation

### Netflix Dataset Exercises:

1. **Is there any missing rating?**
    - Identify if there are any missing values in the 'rating' column using `pandas`.
2. **How many films in 2021 correspond to your country?**

    - Calculate the average number of film releases per year from 2010 onwards.

### Titanic Dataset Exercises:

1. **Calculate Gender-Based Survival Percentage**
    - Compute the survival percentages for each gender.

2. **Calculate Survival Percentage Grouped by Gender and Class**
    - Calculate the survival percentages grouped by both gender and class.

### Visualization:

- **Gender-Based Survival Bar Graph:**
    - Use `matplotlib` to create bar graphs showing survival percentages by gender and class, including labels, title, and legend.
